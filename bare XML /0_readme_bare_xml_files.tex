This folder contains the bare xml files that were sometimes taken from the GitHub folders, two times from the TLG and sometimes were produced according to the text by Hill. All of the files were revised according to the edition by Hill. Every file contains the path from where the text is taken. 
There is a spreadsheet where one can find all this information in the order in which Hill mentions the sources. This is the link refering to this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dDuAS9vXrrvMczAIja8oUhmPhU-nHQ7lPsTT3wDsVdg/edit#gid=0.
Yet there are no passages by Thucydides in this folder as those texts have already been treebanked or at least put into a xml-file.
